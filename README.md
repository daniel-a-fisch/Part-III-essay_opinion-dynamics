# Part III essay: opinion dynamics
I have written the following Julia code for my essay on Modeling of Opinion Dynamics as part of my degree at the University of Cambridge (Part III of the Mathematical Tripos).
A short description of my work is available on my [website](https://daniel-a-fisch.github.io/portfolio/opinion-dynamics-HK/). Julia 1.8.5 was installed with packages as of April 2023.
